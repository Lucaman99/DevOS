# DevOS

An online operating system emulator, geared towards code development.

Coded In:
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - Javascript and jQuery
  - Eventually, other languages and libraries such as PHP, SQL, and Node.js will hopefully be added
  
At the moment, DevOS uses labelled cookies to remember its data (it is only meant to remember local data), but hopefully Node.js and SQL will allow for information to be stored in a more efficient way.
